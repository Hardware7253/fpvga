# FP-V-GA
A simple fpga graphics card which is heavily paremeterized, thus supporting many different image resolutions and timing requirements. The project is preconfigured to work on a tang nano 9k, using resistor voltage dividers as a dac.
A rust project is also included to easily generate the hex files which the graphics card uses.

Only static images are supported
